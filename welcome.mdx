Welcome to **Docket**, your AI-powered QA testing agent. Docket simulates real user behavior to identify broken flows, confusing UX, and unresponsive elements—so you can catch issues before your users do.

With Docket, you can:

- Run end-to-end tests using intelligent agents
- Automatically catch poor UX, not just broken buttons
- Create flows by clicking through your app—no coding needed
- Add app-specific guidance through agent rules
- Get structured bug reports with failure reasons

Docket doesn't just ask "does it work?" It asks, "would a real user succeed?"
