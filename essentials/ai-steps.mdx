### Overview

AI steps are natural-language instructions that tell Docket's intelligent agent what to **do** or **verify** in your application.  
Unlike [cached steps](/essentials/cached-steps), which replay recorded coordinates, AI steps use Docket's **vision and reasoning models** to dynamically interpret your instructions and act accordingly.

There are two main types of AI steps in Docket:
1. **AI Step** – perform an action  
2. **Assert** – verify a condition  

You can mix and match AI steps and cached steps to build powerful, adaptive, and self-healing tests.

### AI Step

An **AI Step** tells Docket to perform an action in your application. You can write these in two styles depending on how explicit or goal-oriented you want to be.

#### Explicit (Step-by-Step)

This style tells Docket exactly what to do, one action at a time. It’s ideal for debugging or when you need strict determinism.

**Example:**
- Click on the "Login" button. Click on the "Email" input field. Type "nishant@docketqa.com". Click on the "Password" input field. Type "password123". Click on the "Sign In" button.


**Pros:**
- Predictable and repeatable  
- Easier to debug and isolate issues  
- Good for pixel-precise UI validation  

**Cons:**
- Can be verbose for longer flows  
- May need updating after UI redesigns  

#### Objective-Based

This style focuses on *what* you want to achieve rather than *how* to achieve it.  
It’s useful for dynamic interfaces, forms, or multi-step workflows that may change layout.

**Example:**
- Login using "nishant@docketqa.com" and "password123".


**Pros:**
- Short and human-readable  
- More resilient to UI changes  
- Uses full page context and reasoning  

**Cons:**
- Less deterministic when multiple valid paths exist  
- Can be harder to debug exact click paths

### Special Capabilities

Certain actions—such as **sending or checking emails** and **uploading files**—can only be performed using AI steps. These actions require contextual reasoning and browser-level access that cached steps don’t support.

**Examples:**
- Upload the file "contract.pdf" to the upload input on the page.
- Check the inbox for a verification code and enter it into the confirmation field.


Docket’s agent will handle the entire sequence intelligently, linking file uploads and email variables (like `@registration_email`) to the current test run.

---

### Assert Step

An **Assert** step tells Docket to verify that a condition holds true at the current state of your application.  
When you write an assertion, Docket takes a **screenshot**, analyzes the page using its **vision model**, and uses prior test history to understand context.

**Examples:**
- Assert that the dashboard shows at least 3 recent orders.
- Assert that a success message appears saying "Account created successfully."


If the assertion fails, Docket will mark the test as **failed**, capture a screenshot and reasoning log, and continue or stop depending on your test configuration.

### Writing Good Assertions

Well-written assertions make your tests reliable and meaningful. Poorly defined ones can make results ambiguous.  
Follow these guidelines for clarity and precision:

| Problem | Bad Example | Improved Example |
|----------|--------------|------------------|
| Missing `assert` keyword | Look for search results on the main body | **Assert** that there are search results displayed on the main body |
| Ambiguous goal | Assert that results are correct | Assert that search results are sorted by date |
| Unverifiable statement | Assert that the page looks good | Assert that no text in the table overflows its cell |
| Too precise for minor details | Assert that the divider color is #ff5733 | Assert that the divider appears red |
| Time-based check | Assert that the video plays a 10-second ad | Avoid timing-based assertions |

> **Note**  
> Synonyms like `verify`, `check`, `ensure`, or `validate` are also recognized as assertions,  
> but we recommend using `assert` for consistency and accuracy.

### Early Termination

Docket can mark a test as failed without completing the entire flow if it detects usability issues that would frustrate a real user.

The agent will fail the test early if it encounters:

- The feature is not easily findable and requires navigating through multiple menus or sections  
- The interface uses non-standard or unintuitive patterns  
- The task takes significantly more steps or retries than expected  
- There are visible errors, missing features, or unresponsive UI elements  
- The interface is confusing due to unclear labeling, layout, or navigation  
- The tester is unsure how to proceed because the next step isn't obvious or discoverable  

Even without an explicit assertion, encountering any of the above will cause the test to fail—unless specified otherwise. You can craft your prompt accordingly if you'd like to override this behavior.

> **Tip**: This behavior ensures Docket catches not just broken functionality, but also poor user experiences that could lead to user frustration or abandonment.

### Testing AI Steps in the Remote Browser

When working with AI steps during test creation, you can test them in real-time using the remote browser. Simply write an AI step and click the **play button** next to it while the remote browser is running. Docket will execute that step immediately in the browser, allowing you to:

- Verify the step works as expected
- See the agent's reasoning in real-time
- Iterate quickly on your test instructions
- Observe how the agent interprets your natural language commands

This live testing capability helps you refine your AI steps before running the full test, ensuring your instructions are clear and effective.

### Combining Cached and AI Steps

You can combine [cached steps](/essentials/cached-steps) and AI steps to achieve a balance of precision and flexibility.

| Use Case | Recommended Step |
|-----------|------------------|
| Deterministic clicks or scrolls | **[Cached Step](/essentials/cached-steps)** |
| Dynamic workflows or variable layouts | **AI Step** |
| Page validations or checks | **Assert Step** |
| File uploads or email actions | **AI Step** |

**Example Combined Flow:**
- [Cached Step] Click "Sign In"
- [AI Step] Login using "nishant@docketqa.com" and "password123"
- [Assert Step] Assert that the dashboard loads successfully

> **Learn more**: See [Cached Steps](/essentials/cached-steps) to understand how coordinate-based actions work and when to use them.

### Summary

AI steps let Docket act like an intelligent QA engineer—capable of reasoning about your app, understanding page state, and verifying outcomes based on real visual context.  
By blending **AI steps** for logic, **cached steps** for precision, and **asserts** for validation, you can build robust, adaptive, and human-like test flows that evolve with your product.
