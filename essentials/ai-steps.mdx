### Overview

AI steps are natural-language instructions that tell Docket’s intelligent agent what to **do** or **verify** in your application.  
Unlike cached steps, which replay recorded coordinates, AI steps use Docket’s **vision and reasoning models** to dynamically interpret your instructions and act accordingly.

There are two main types of AI steps in Docket:
1. **AI Step** – perform an action  
2. **Assert** – verify a condition  

You can mix and match AI steps and cached steps to build powerful, adaptive, and self-healing tests.

### AI Step

An **AI Step** tells Docket to perform an action in your application. You can write these in two styles depending on how explicit or goal-oriented you want to be.

#### Explicit (Step-by-Step)

This style tells Docket exactly what to do, one action at a time. It’s ideal for debugging or when you need strict determinism.

**Example:**
- Click on the "Login" button. Click on the "Email" input field. Type "nishant@docketqa.com". Click on the "Password" input field. Type "password123". Click on the "Sign In" button.


**Pros:**
- Predictable and repeatable  
- Easier to debug and isolate issues  
- Good for pixel-precise UI validation  

**Cons:**
- Can be verbose for longer flows  
- May need updating after UI redesigns  

#### Objective-Based

This style focuses on *what* you want to achieve rather than *how* to achieve it.  
It’s useful for dynamic interfaces, forms, or multi-step workflows that may change layout.

**Example:**
- Login using "nishant@docketqa.com" and "password123".


**Pros:**
- Short and human-readable  
- More resilient to UI changes  
- Uses full page context and reasoning  

**Cons:**
- Less deterministic when multiple valid paths exist  
- Can be harder to debug exact click paths

### Special Capabilities

Certain actions—such as **sending or checking emails** and **uploading files**—can only be performed using AI steps. These actions require contextual reasoning and browser-level access that cached steps don’t support.

**Examples:**
- Upload the file "contract.pdf" to the upload input on the page.
- Check the inbox for a verification code and enter it into the confirmation field.


Docket’s agent will handle the entire sequence intelligently, linking file uploads and email variables (like `@registration_email`) to the current test run.

### Assert Step

An **Assert** step tells Docket to verify that a condition holds true at the current state of your application.  
When you write an assertion, Docket takes a **screenshot**, analyzes the page using its **vision model**, and uses prior test history to understand context.

**Examples:**
- Assert that the dashboard shows at least 3 recent orders.
- Assert that a success message appears saying "Account created successfully."


If the assertion fails, Docket will mark the test as **failed**, capture a screenshot and reasoning log, and continue or stop depending on your test configuration.

### Writing Good Assertions

Well-written assertions make your tests reliable and meaningful. Poorly defined ones can make results ambiguous.  
Follow these guidelines for clarity and precision:

| Problem | Bad Example | Improved Example |
|----------|--------------|------------------|
| Missing `assert` keyword | Look for search results on the main body | **Assert** that there are search results displayed on the main body |
| Ambiguous goal | Assert that results are correct | Assert that search results are sorted by date |
| Unverifiable statement | Assert that the page looks good | Assert that no text in the table overflows its cell |
| Too precise for minor details | Assert that the divider color is #ff5733 | Assert that the divider appears red |
| Time-based check | Assert that the video plays a 10-second ad | Avoid timing-based assertions |

> **Note**  
> Synonyms like `verify`, `check`, `ensure`, or `validate` are also recognized as assertions,  
> but we recommend using `assert` for consistency and accuracy.

### Combining Cached and AI Steps

You can combine cached steps and AI steps to achieve a balance of precision and flexibility.

| Use Case | Recommended Step |
|-----------|------------------|
| Deterministic clicks or scrolls | **Cached Step** |
| Dynamic workflows or variable layouts | **AI Step** |
| Page validations or checks | **Assert Step** |
| File uploads or email actions | **AI Step** |

**Example Combined Flow:**
- [Cached Step] Click “Sign In”
- [AI Step] Login using "nishant@docketqa.com" and "password123"
- [Assert Step] Assert that the dashboard loads successfully


---

### Summary

AI steps let Docket act like an intelligent QA engineer—capable of reasoning about your app, understanding page state, and verifying outcomes based on real visual context.  
By blending **AI steps** for logic, **cached steps** for precision, and **asserts** for validation, you can build robust, adaptive, and human-like test flows that evolve with your product.
