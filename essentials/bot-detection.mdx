## Docket IP Allowlist

To prevent our automated requests from being blocked, please allow-list the following IP addresses in your security systems:

```
66.241.125.240/32
213.188.221.104/32
```

These IPs should be allowlisted in:
- Firewalls
- Bot detection systems
- Rate limiting rules
- WAF configurations

## Clerk Bot Detection

If you see a Clerk bot detection page in one of your test failures, you have likely enabled Clerk Bot Detection turned on.

Docket's AI is running in a headless browser, which is often detected as a bot by Clerk. There are two ways to resolve this:

### 1. Disable Clerk Bot Detection on staging

Clerk does not have a granular way to allowlist User-Agent. The best way to resolve this is to disable Clerk Bot Detection on staging.

### 2. Create a simple API to return a session token to Stably

Clerk enables services to bypass bot detection by attaching a session token to the request. You can read more about it [here](https://clerk.com/docs/guides/development/testing/overview#testing-tokens).

If you want to test on production or keep Clerk bot detection on for staging, you can implement an API that returns a session token.

The API is necessary because session tokens are short-lived and require your Clerk tokens to generate, therefore only you can generate it.

Here is an example of how you can implement this API:

```javascript
import { clerkClient } from "@clerk/clerk-express";

const clerk = clerkClient({
  secretKey: process.env.CLERK_SECRET_KEY,
}); 

app.post("/session", async (req, res) => {
  const { clerkToken } = req.body;
  const session = await clerk.sessions.create({
    userId: clerkToken,
  });
  res.json(session);
});
```

Once you have the API, you can add it in advanced settings.
