You can upload multiple files as shown in the Files tab above. Each file appears with its filename and can be individually managed. 

To use a specific file in your test, reference it by name: `upload "cat.jpeg" to the profile picture` or `upload "ZDummy_PDF.pdf" to the document field`. For single file uploads, simply say `upload file`.
