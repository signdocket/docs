### Dedicated Mailboxes

Dedicated mailboxes allow our agent to read and extract content from emails sent to an address generated by Docket.
Our agent can only access unread emails that were delivered within the past 1 hour. This feature is perfect
for OTP codes, magic links, invitation links, password reset links, verification emails, and more.

Please note that the agent cannot send emails. If you have a use case that requires sending emails, please contact the Docket team.

### Creating a Dedicated Mailbox

To create a dedicated mailbox, navigate to the settings page in your Docket dashboard.

### Email Filtering and Selection

When multiple emails arrive in your dedicated mailbox, you can prompt the agent to filter for specific emails using subject keywords. This ensures the agent interacts with the correct email when multiple messages are present.

The agent will search through emails from the past hour and the next minute (in case the email is lagging) and match based on the subject line keywords you specify in your prompt.

### Mailbox State Visibility

During test execution, you can view the state of your mailbox at the time of any email-related tool call by clicking the mail button in the test interface. This modal shows:

- **Matching email** is processed by the agent
- All emails present in the mailbox at that moment
- Email timestamps and subject lines for easy identification

This visibility feature helps you understand exactly which emails the agent found and interacted with during your test run.

## Prompting Best Practices

- "Look for an email with 'verification' in the subject and click the confirmation link"
- "Find the email containing 'password reset' in the subject line and use the reset link"
- "Search for an email with 'invoice' in the subject and extract the order number"
- "Get the OTP code from the email with 'two-factor' or '2FA' in the subject"
