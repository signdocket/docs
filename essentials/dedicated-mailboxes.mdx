### Dedicated Mailboxes

Dedicated mailboxes allow our agent to read and extract content from emails sent to an address generated by Docket.
Our agent can only access unread emails that were delivered within the past 5 minutes. This feature is perfect
for OTP codes, magic links, invitation links, password reset links, verification emails, and more.

Please note that the agent cannot send emails. If you have a use case that requires sending emails, please contact the Docket team.

### Creating a Dedicated Mailbox

To create a dedicated mailbox, navigate to the settings page in your Docket dashboard.

## Prompting Best Practices

Here are examples of prompts that can be used to access the mailbox:
- "If prompted for an OTP/2FA code, fetch it from email and use it"
- "Navigate to the invitation link URL sent to email"
- "Fetch the purchase confirmation email and assert the order contains what you purchased"
