### Test Suite

First, you should go to the [test suites](/essentials/test-suite) to create a test suite that the test can be included in.

### Test Metadata

You will begin by providing a title, URL, and test suite for the test.

The URL will be the starting point for the test. The Docket Browser agent will automatically navigate there and then start executing your instruction set.

### Writing a good test

You write tests in Docket as a single prompt. Think of it as describing what you would like to see tested to a human who is savy as using web applications but has never interacted with your application before.

Each test should try to cover a single objective. Examples of objectives might include:

- Adding item to a shopping cart
- Completing the onboarding form for an application
- Testing the filtering on a table
- Searching a query and verifying top result is relevant

To write a test simply input your prompt into the instructions section of the test creation page.

### Assertions in tests

If you would like Docket to perform an explict check on any behavior of your application (e.g. click clear cart actually clears the cart), then you can tell Docket to `assert` for that behaviour in your application. This will result in Docket making an "assertion" action where it will take all the context it has on your test run and a screenshot of the page to assess whether or not your assertion was met. If not, Docket will fail the test. If met, Docket will proceed with the test.

When using the assert statement, you should be verify specific in the behaviour you would like to verify. If there is room for ambigiouty, then the test might end up being flakey. Here are some examples of poorly crafted asserts and how you might go about fixing them:

| Problem                                | Bad example                                                        | Corrected example                                               |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Missing assert keyword                 | Look for search results on the main body                           | Assert that there are search results displayed on the main body |
| Ambiguous assertion                    | Assert that the order of the results is correct                    | Assert that the search results are sorted by date               |
| Assertion about imperceivable details  | Assert that the color of line divider is #ff5733                   | Assert that the color of the divider looks red                  |
| Subjective assertion                   | Asserted that the page looks well designed                         | Assert that no text in the table overflows its cell             |
| Assertion depends on changes over time | The video plays a 10-second advertisement for an insurance product | N/A                                                             |

<Note>
  Other terms such as `verify` / `check` /`confirm` /`ensure` / `validate` also result in an assertion action, but we  recommend  `assert`  as Docket has been specially trained to respond to that word.
</Note>

### Early termination

Docket has the ability to mark the test as failed without going through the entire flow if it deems: 

- The feature is not immediately findable and requires exploring multiple menus or sections
- The interface uses non-standard or unintuitive patterns to complete the task
- The task takes more steps or attempts than expected for a straightforward action
- There are visible errors, missing features, or unresponsive UI elements
- The interface creates confusion due to unclear labeling, layout, or navigation logic
- The tester is unsure how to proceed because the next step isn’t obvious or discoverable

Even if there is not explicit assertion, encountering any of the above will mark the test as failed unless otherwise specified. You can craft your prompt accordingly if you would like to overwrite any of these instructions.

### Running a simulation

Simulations on the test creation page are available to give to live preview of a test run. They use the exact same infrastructure as a real test run, so you get to view behaviour ahead of a real test run. To run a simulation, click the "Run" button present in the instructions input header.

You give will a live feed of your test in the Test Preview window along with the Docket agent's reasoning present in the "Actions" tab.
