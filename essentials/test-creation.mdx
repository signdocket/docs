### Prerequisites

First, go to the [test suites](/essentials/test-suite) page to create a test suite that the test will belong to.

### Creating a Test

To get started with writing a test on Docket, you should: 
1. Navigate to the tests tab on the left
2. Click "Create New Test"
3. Enter a title, select a test suite, and provide an entrypoint URL (the starting point for your test)
4. Click "Launch Browser"

The URL you provide will be where the Docket Browser agent automatically navigates to begin executing your test.

### Building Your Test

To create tests on Docket, you can simply interact in the remote browser and Docket will record actions alongside English annotations automatically. 

There are two types of steps you can write on Docket:
1. **[Cached Steps](/essentials/cached-steps)** - Precise coordinate-based actions that replay exactly as recorded
2. **[AI Steps](/essentials/ai-steps)** - Natural language instructions that adapt to your UI dynamically

Learn more about each step type to understand when to use them.

### Test Variables

Docket supports two types of variables that can be used to make your tests more dynamic and reusable. Variables can be created in the Variables tab of the test and inserted into your test instructions by pressing the `@` key while writing.

#### Text Variables

Text variables are simple placeholders that get replaced with their configured values when your test runs. They're ideal for making tests flexible and reusable across different environments or scenarios.

**Common use cases:**
- **Credentials**: Usernames and passwords when not using the accounts feature
- **Test data**: Product names, user IDs, or any values that you might want to change often

**Example usage:**
```
Log in with username @test_username and password @test_password.
Search for @product_name and add it to the cart.
```

#### Email Variables

Email variables are more sophisticated and generate a unique mailbox for each test run using plus addressing. This creates a dedicated email address that the agent can monitor during that specific test execution.

Key features of email variables:
- **Unique per run**: Each test execution gets its own email address (e.g., `baseaddress+unique123@domain.com`)
- **Agent accessibility**: The agent can only check emails sent to this specific unique address during the test run
- **Full address reference**: You can reference the complete generated email address in your instructions when you need to input it into forms

**Example usage:**
```
Register a new account using @registration_email as the email address. 
After registering, get the confirmation code from the email and use it to confirm your account
```

In this example, `@registration_email` would be replaced with the unique email address generated for that test run, and the agent would monitor only that specific mailbox for incoming emails.

#### Using Variables in Instructions

To insert variables while writing test steps: just reference the variable using "@variable_name" and Docket will auto-populate it during runtime.

Variables make your tests more maintainable and allow you to easily run the same test logic with different data across multiple environments or scenarios.

### Advanced Test Configuration

Configure additional settings to fine-tune your test execution behavior.

#### Browser Zoom Level
Control the browser's zoom level (equivalent to `Ctrl +/-` in Chromium). Useful for testing responsive design and accessibility.
**Options:** 50%, 75%, 100% (default), 125%, 150%, 200%

#### Test Retries
Configure automatic retries when a test fails. Docket will re-run the entire test from the beginning.
**Options:** No retries (default), 1-3 retries

#### Test Status
- **Active** (default): Test runs in all scenarios
- **Paused**: Test is excluded from scheduled runs, CI/CD, and group executions

#### Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)
Store TOTP secrets for automated 2FA during testing. Enter the secret key from your authenticator app setup, and Docket will automatically generate codes when prompted.
