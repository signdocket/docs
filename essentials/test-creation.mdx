### Test Suite

First, go to the [test suites](/essentials/test-suite) page to create a test suite that the test will belong to.

### Test Metadata

Begin by providing a title, URL, and selecting a test suite for the test.

The URL is the starting point for the test. The Docket Browser agent will automatically navigate to this URL and begin executing your instruction set.

### Writing a Good Test

You write tests in Docket as a single prompt. Think of it as describing what you want tested to a human who is savvy with web applications but has never interacted with yours before.

Each test should cover a single objective. Examples of test objectives include:

- Adding an item to a shopping cart  
- Completing the onboarding form for an application  
- Testing the filtering functionality on a table  
- Searching a query and verifying that the top result is relevant  

To write a test, simply enter your prompt into the "Instructions" section on the test creation page.

### Assertions in Tests

If you'd like Docket to perform an explicit check on the behavior of your application (e.g., ensuring that clicking "Clear Cart" actually clears the cart), you can instruct Docket to `assert` that behavior. This tells Docket to perform an "assertion" action—evaluating the result using all the test context and a screenshot of the page. If the assertion fails, Docket will mark the test as failed. If it passes, the test will continue.

When using the `assert` statement, be specific about the behavior you're verifying. If the instruction is ambiguous, the test might become flaky. Here are examples of common mistakes and how to fix them:

| Problem                                | Bad Example                                                        | Improved Example                                                 |
|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Missing `assert` keyword               | Look for search results on the main body                           | Assert that there are search results displayed on the main body |
| Ambiguous assertion                    | Assert that the order of the results is correct                    | Assert that the search results are sorted by date               |
| Assertion about imperceptible details  | Assert that the color of the line divider is #ff5733               | Assert that the divider appears red                             |
| Subjective assertion                   | Assert that the page looks well-designed                           | Assert that no text in the table overflows its cell             |
| Assertion depends on time-based change | The video plays a 10-second ad for an insurance product            | N/A                                                              |

> **Note**  
> Other terms such as `verify`, `check`, `confirm`, `ensure`, or `validate` will also result in an assertion action. However, we recommend using `assert`, as Docket has been specially trained to respond to this term.

### Early Termination

Docket can mark a test as failed without completing the entire flow if it detects:

- The feature is not easily findable and requires navigating through multiple menus or sections  
- The interface uses non-standard or unintuitive patterns  
- The task takes significantly more steps or retries than expected  
- There are visible errors, missing features, or unresponsive UI elements  
- The interface is confusing due to unclear labeling, layout, or navigation  
- The tester is unsure how to proceed because the next step isn’t obvious or discoverable  

Even without an explicit assertion, encountering any of the above will cause the test to fail—unless specified otherwise. You can craft your prompt accordingly if you'd like to override this behavior.

### Running a Simulation

Simulations on the test creation page give you a live preview of a test run. They use the same infrastructure as a real test, so you can observe behavior ahead of time. To run a simulation, click the "Run" button in the instructions input header.

You’ll get a live feed of the test in the **Test Preview** window, along with the Docket agent’s reasoning shown in the **Actions** tab.
