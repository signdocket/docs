### Overview

The Docket tunnel lets you run tests against your local development environment without exposing it to the public internet. Only your authenticated Docket account can access the proxied services.

### Install the CLI

Download and install the Docket CLI from our official distribution:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://api.docketqa.com/tunnel/install | bash
```

Add the CLI to your PATH:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.docket/bin:$PATH"
```

> **Tip**: Add the export line to your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.) to make it permanent.

### Authenticate

Link the CLI to your Docket account. This account will be the only one with access to services exposed over the tunnel:

```bash
docket auth
```

### Start the Tunnel

Provide all local service URLs needed for running tests (frontend, backend, etc.). Only HTTP(S) traffic to these URLs is proxied:

```bash
docket start http://localhost:3000 http://localhost:5000
```

While the tunnel is running:
- Your local services are accessible from within your authenticated Docket account
- Resources are **not** accessible from the public internet or any other Docket account
- Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the tunnel

### Running Tests Against Local Builds

To run a test against your local build, update the test's entrypoint URL to the local URL you normally use (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`). Alternatively, you can use the generated `docket-tunnel.com` URL.

The Docket browser agent will route traffic through the tunnel to reach your local services.
