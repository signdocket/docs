### Test Suite

Test Suites are a collection of tests on Docket. They are used to organize tests into logical groups that you might want to run together.

### Creating a test suite

To create a test suite, proceed to the test suites tab.

### Login Modules

You can assign a login module to a test suite, which will be used to authenticate all tests in that test suite. The instructions from the login module will be executed first, then the state (cookies, local storage) that the browser ends up in will be copied over as a starting point in all other test runs.

You must provide the "Navigate to..." instruction at the beginning of your login module. Here is an example:

Then you can assign this as the login module for any test suite:

### Scheduling a test suite

You can also schedule all tests in a given test suite to run at some cadence. See "Runinng a test" section for instructions on how to set this up.
