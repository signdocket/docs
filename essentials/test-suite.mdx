### Test Suite

Test suites are collections of tests on Docket. They are used to organize tests into logical groups that you might want to run together.

> **Next Step**: After creating a test suite, you can [create individual tests](/essentials/test-creation) to add to the suite.

### Creating a test suite

To create a test suite, navigate to the test suites tab.

From there, click the "New Test Suite" button and give your test suite a suitable name.

### Accounts

Think of accounts as username and password configurations that Docket uses to log in. You can assign accounts to test suites, which will then use that account to authenticate for all tests in the suite. 

Docket will navigate to the provided URL and log in with the credentials. The browser state (cookies, local storage) that results from this login will be copied as the starting point for all other test runs.

You can then assign this account as the login module for any test suite:

### Scheduling a Test Suite

You can also schedule all tests in a given test suite to run at regular intervals. See the [scheduling section](/essentials/running-test#scheduling-a-run) in the Running a Test guide for instructions on how to set this up.
