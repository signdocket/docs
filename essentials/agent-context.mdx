### Agent Rules

If there is certain context that is specific to your application, you can create an agent rule for it. These rules injected into Docket's system prompt when running your tests to help the agent navigate your applications. Examples of things to create an agent rule might be: 

- The “Create Project” button is only visible after hovering over the sidebar and clicking the plus icon
- The onboarding modal must be dismissed before any part of the dashboard becomes interactive
- To invite a teammate, go to “Workspace Settings” via the top-right dropdown, then open the “Members” tab
- “Add to Cart” is labeled as “Reserve Now” on product detail pages for rental items
- The “Submit for Approval” button only appears after all form fields are valid and the form auto-saves

You can configure these agent rules from the agent rule tab on the Docket dashboard.
