### 1. Create a new test suite with tests
- Create a new [test suite](essentials/test-suite).
- Create a [new test](essentials/test-creation) and give Docket a testing prompt for a flow you would like to see tested.

### 2. Add Agent Rules (Optional)
- Help the agent understand app-specific behavior via [agent rules](essentials/agent-context).

### 3. Run the Test
- [Run the test](essentials/running-test) manually, schedule it, or build a [CI/CD integration](essentials/ci-integration).
  
### 4. Review the Results
- Tests return a clear pass/fail outcome
- If failed, Docket gives a concise reason whyâ€”based on real usability criteria

ðŸ’¡ **Note**: Docket fails fast. If a real user would be confused, blocked, or slowed down, the test fails by design.
